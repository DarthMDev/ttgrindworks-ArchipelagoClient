# Toontown: The Grindworks

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page](../player-settings) contains the options needed to configure
your game session.

## What does randomization do to this game?

When connected to a multiworld, all characters apart from those received in the
multiworld will be unlocked. You may receive characters that you have not unlocked in
vanilla play, but these will be locked again when you disconnect.

Treasure chests in-game are replaced with Archipelago "check" items. When picked up,
these will send a check to the multiworld. Depending on your settings, normal treasure
chests may not appear when randomized.

Depending on your settings, the shop may have less than the default amount  in it.
You will have to unlock more slots by finding "Progressive Shop" items in the
multiworld. 

All game progress apart from characters (achievements, etc.)
are not affected by the randomizer.


## What is the goal?

The goal is to beat all floors and the bosses on the executive floor. Depending on your
settings, you may be able to win  with any character, or your may need to win with a specific character.

## What is a "check"?

Completing a floor by beating a boss. and picking up treasures chests throughout facilities and beating cogs. How many  chests are checks are defined in the
randomizer settings.

## What "items" can you unlock?

    drops mimics the actual game's.
